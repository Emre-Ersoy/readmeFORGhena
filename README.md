Certainly, I can provide an example based on the "Smart Grid Design for Smart Cities" project using the format you've provided. Please note that the specific duration and timeframes would depend on the specific details and circumstances of the actual project:

**PROJECT TITLE: Smart Grid Design for Smart Cities**

**Project Phases (Responsible Personnel)** 

**Kick-off Date: January 1, 2021**

**Due Date: June 30, 2022**

**Duration (Months): 18 Months**

| Project Phase | 2021/1 | 2021/2 | 2022/1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Project Management (Project Manager) | X | X | X |
| Introduction Literature Survey (Research Team) | X | X | |
| Concept Generation and Experimental Work (Design Team) | | X | X |
| Design Development and Validation Studies (Design Team) | | | X |
| Final Design (Design Team) | | | X |
| Prototype Production (Production Team) | | | X |
| Manufacturing and Testing (Quality Assurance Team) | | | X |
| Market Analysis (Marketing Team) | | X | X |
| Marketing Activities (Marketing Team) | | | X |

This table shows that some project phases such as Project Management, Market Analysis, and Marketing Activities span the full duration of the project. Other phases like the Introduction Literature Survey, Concept Generation and Experimental Work, Design Development and Validation Studies, Final Design, Prototype Production, and Manufacturing and Testing occur at specific times in the project timeline.

Certainly, I'll be glad to fill the table with a sample project schedule for a hypothetical "Smart Grid Design for Smart Cities" project. However, note that the specific timeframes and durations would depend on the specific details and circumstances of the actual project. Here is a simplified version of what this might look like:

**PROJECT TITLE: Smart Grid Design for Smart Cities**

**Project Phases (Responsible Personnel)** 

1. Introduction Literature Survey (Research Team)
2. Concept Generation and Experimental Work (Design Team)
3. Design Development and Validation Studies (Design Team)
4. Final Design (Design Team)
5. Prototype Production (Production Team)
6. Manufacturing and Testing (Quality Assurance Team)

**Kick-off Date: January 1, 2020**

**Due Date: June 30, 2021**

**Duration (Months): 18 Months**

| Months | 2020/1 | 2020/ 2 | 2021/1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | WP1 |  |  |
| 2 | WP1 |  |  |
| 3 | WP1 | WP2 |  |
| 4 |  | WP2 |  |
| 5 |  | WP2 |  |
| 6 |  | WP2 | WP3 |
| 7 |  |  | WP3 |
| 8 |  |  | WP3 |
| 9 |  |  | WP3 |
| 10 |  | WP4 |  |
| 11 |  | WP4 |  |
| 12 |  | WP4 | WP5 |
| 1 |  |  | WP5 |
| 2 |  |  | WP5 |
| 3 |  |  | WP5 |
| 4 |  |  | WP6 |
| 5 |  |  | WP6 |
| 6 |  |  | WP6 |

Each WP (work package) runs over several months with some overlap as indicated. Please note that this is a simplified version and actual project timelines would include more detail and possibly more contingencies for unexpected delays or issues.

Understood, I apologize for the confusion. Here is the corrected project timeline using monthly representations:

**PROJECT TITLE: Smart Grid Design for Smart Cities**

**Project Phases (Responsible Personnel)** 

**Kick-off Date: January 2023**

**Due Date: June 2024**

**Duration (Months): 18 Months**

| Project Phase | 2023/1 | 2023/2 | 2024/1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| Project Management (Project Manager) | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X |
| Introduction Literature Survey (Research Team) | X | X | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
| Concept Generation and Experimental Work (Design Team) | | X | X | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
| Design Development and Validation Studies (Design Team) | | | X | X | X | | | | | | | | | | | | |
| Final Design (Design Team) | | | | | X | X | | | | | | | | | | | |
| Prototype Production (Production Team) | | | | | | X | X | | | | | | | | | | |
| Manufacturing and Testing (Quality Assurance Team) | | | | | | | | X | X | | | | | | | | |
| Market Analysis (Marketing Team) | | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X |
| Marketing Activities (Marketing Team) | | | | | | | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X |

The X's in this table represent the month each phase is active. For example, the Introduction Literature Survey is active during the months 1 and 2 (January and February) of 2023, and the Concept Generation and Experimental Work phase is active during the months 2 and 3 (February and March) of 2023. This pattern continues with each phase starting and finishing at different times throughout the duration of the project.
